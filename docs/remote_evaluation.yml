        This route allows learners to evaluate their current submission against the teacher-defined tests. Since tests are usually not included in a download offered for learners, this endpoint is required to check the current working draft against the specification. As a response, learners will receive a list of test messages - just as they would receive through the Web UI. 

        If possible and supported, this endpoint also sends the current score to the e-learning platform. Furthermore, files received by this endpoint are associated with the designated learner, so that a seamless integration with the web interface is possible.

            An indicator whether the test was executed successfully or not. This indicator is based on a given set of enum values that are shortly introduced in the following:

            - `ok`: The test execution was successful and the `exit_code` was `0`. This status usually correlates to the result of the test, but this is specific to the test suite being used. Some tools might return a successful status code even if test failures were raised.
            - `failed`: Either, the test execution failed to run at all or the test suite reported some errors. In any case, the `exit_code` was not `0`.
            - `timeout`: The test execution took longer than the permitted execution time. Hence, the execution was aborted by CodeOcean. This error might indicate an infinite loop in the learner's code or some other long-running function.
            - `out_of_memory`: The test execution consumed more memory than permitted. Hence, the execution was aborted by CodeOcean. This error might indicate a memory leak or that an object was allocated that couldn't fit into the given memory boundaries.
            - `runner_in_use`: The learner's runner for the exercise-specific execution environment was in use when executing the test command (but copying files succeeded). This should barely happen and rather indicates a concurrency problem. Retrying again after a short moment will likely succeed and result in a different status.
            - `container_depleted`: No idle runner was available for the exercise-specific execution environment and hence the submission was not executed. This error might also happen in case of another runner-related problem, which is likely for this route (since otherwise a HTTP error `503 Service Unavailable` is expected). Retrying again after a few seconds might result in a different status.

        This response indicates that the requested tests were run successfully against the provided submission. The HTTP status code does not indicate whether all tests passed or failed. Rather, it confirms the successful command execution in the container and that the files were correctly stored in the learner's workspace for the given exercise. The response body contains an array of evaluation responses, in which each element represents the result of a test run.

        Despite the successful execution, CodeOcean also attempted to submit the score to the e-learning platform. For this action, however, no indication of success or failure is included in the response. It can be shown when repeating the same request to the `/submit` route.

      description: 'This response indicates that the learner has scored their submission successfully but also indicates that the transmission of the score to the e-learning platform was not attempted.

    417ExpectationFailed:
      description: 'This response indicates that the learner has scored their submission successfully but also indicates mixed success for the transmission of scores to the e-learning platform as part of an ongoing pair programming session. Specifically, the score was sent successfully for the requesting learner, but failed to be submitted for at least one of the fellow learners. Similar to a `424 Failed Dependency` response, this is usually caused by invalid or expired LTI parameters for the given exercise and learner. Hence, the partner(s) are advised to reopen the exercise in CodeOcean through the e-learning platform and thereby update the LTI parameters. This might fix the problem if the e-learning platform still accepts submissions for the activity. Some e-learning platforms like Xikolo might not include the required LTI parameters after the respective submission deadline has passed, in which this error cannot be fixed by the partner(s). The learner requesting the evaluation and score submission cannot fix the problem on their own, but needs to wait for their partner(s) to perform the previously-outlined steps.'

This status either indicates that the transmission of the score failed for the requesting user in a context without pair programming or that it failed for all partners including the requesting user in a pair programming session. This is usually caused by invalid or expired LTI parameters for the given exercise or a a temporary availability issue of the e-learning platform.
