# Vagrant setup

With the Vagrant-based setup, you won't need to (manually) install CodeOcean and Poseidon including their dependencies on your local instance. Instead, a virtual machine containing all requirements will be configured.

## Install VirtualBox

**macOS:**
```shell
brew install --cask virtualbox
```

**Linux:**
```shell
wget -O- https://www.virtualbox.org/download/oracle_vbox_2016.asc | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/oracle-virtualbox-2016.gpg >/dev/null
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/oracle-virtualbox-2016.gpg] https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian $(lsb_release -cs) contrib" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install virtualbox-7.0
```

**Check with:**
```shell
vboxmanage --version
```

## Install Vagrant

**macOS:**
```shell
brew tap hashicorp/tap
brew install hashicorp/tap/hashicorp-vagrant
```

**Linux:**
```shell
wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg >/dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install vagrant
```

**Check with:**
```shell
vagrant -v
```

## Clone repositories

The following two repositories have to be cloned in the same directory. You may either clone the repository via SSH (recommended) or HTTPS (hassle-free for read operations). If you haven't set up GitHub with your SSH key, you might follow [their official guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).

**SSH (recommended, requires initial setup):**
```shell
git clone git@github.com:openHPI/codeocean.git
git clone git@github.com:openHPI/poseidon.git
```

**HTTPS (easier for read operations):**
```shell
git clone https://github.com/openHPI/codeocean.git
git clone https://github.com/openHPI/poseidon.git
```

Vagrant assumes that these repositories are completely clean. For example, Vagrant will setup all configuration files in `config` for CodeOcean based on the examples provided in the same directory. Therefore it is **important** that these configuration files do not exist before running `vagrant up`. It is recommended to have a freshly cloned repository but you can also try to remove untracked files by running `git clean -xf` in both repositories.

## Switch current working directory

```shell
cd codeocean
```

## Start the virtual machine

```shell
vagrant up
```

During the first start, Vagrant will run a provision script and automatically set up all required dependencies. Therefore, the first launch will take a few minutes.

## Start CodeOcean and Poseidon

For the development environment with Vagrant, four server processes are required: the Rails server for the main application, a Webpack server providing JavaScript and CSS assets, the Solid Queue supervisor to process background jobs, and Poseidon to manage runners. As those processes will be run in the virtual machine, you always need to connect to the VM with `vagrant ssh`.

1. Webpack dev server:

This project uses [shakapacker](https://github.com/shakacode/shakapacker) to integrate Webpack with Rails to deliver Frontend assets. During development, the `webpack-dev-server` automatically launches together with the Rails server if not specified otherwise. In case of missing JavaScript or stylesheets and for Hot Module Reloading in the browser, you might want to start the `webpack-dev-server` manually *before starting Rails*:

  ```shell
  vagrant ssh
  cd codeocean
  yarn run webpack-dev-server
  ```

This will launch a dedicated server on port 3035 (default setting) and allow incoming WebSocket connections from your browser.

2. Rails application:

  ```shell
  vagrant ssh
  cd codeocean
  bundle exec rails server --port 7000 --binding 0.0.0.0
  ```

This will launch the CodeOcean web application server on port 7000 (default setting) for all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`) and allow incoming connections from your browser. Listening on all interfaces is required, so that you can connect from your VM-external browser to the Rails server.

3. Solid Queue supervisor:

  ```shell
  vagrant ssh
  cd codeocean
  bundle exec rake solid_queue:start
  ```

This will launch the Solid Queue supervisor to process background jobs.

4. Poseidon:

  ```shell
  vagrant ssh
  cd poseidon
  ./poseidon
  ```

This will launch Poseidon on port 7200 to manage runners and provide them to CodeOcean upon request.

**Check with:**  
Open your web browser at <http://localhost:7000>. Vagrant will redirect requests to your `localhost` automatically to the virtual machine.

The default credentials for the internal users are the following:

- Administrator:  
  email: `admin@example.org`  
  password: `admin`
- Teacher:  
  email: `teacher@example.org`  
  password: `teacher`
- Learner:  
  email: `learner@example.org`  
  password: `learner`

Additional internal users can be created using the web interface. In development, the activation mail is printed to the console. Use the activation link found in that mail to set a password for a new user.

### Execution Environments

Every exercise is executed in an execution environment which is based on a docker image. In order to install a new image, have a look at the container images of the openHPI team on [GitHub](https://github.com/openHPI/dockerfiles) or [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/u/openhpi). You may change execution environments by signing in to your running CodeOcean server as an administrator and select `Execution Environments` from the `Administration` dropdown. The `Docker Container Pool Size` should be greater than 0 for every execution environment you want to use. Please refer to the Poseidon documentation for more information on the [requirements of Docker images](https://github.com/openHPI/poseidon/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#supported-docker-images).

### Metrics (optional)

For exporting metrics, enable the Prometheus exporter in `config/code_ocean.yml` and start an additional server *before starting Rails*:

```shell
vagrant ssh
cd codeocean
bundle exec prometheus_exporter
```

## Known Issues

On MacOS systems, starting the virtual machine might fail due to existing port forwarding on port 7000. This port is used by the MacOS ControlCenter for Apple AirPlay. Therefore, if you are not actively using AirPlay, you can disable it in "System Preferences" --> "General" --> "AirDrop & Handoff" by disabling the "AirPlay Receiver" option. Alternatively, you can edit the Vagrant file and set a different port.
