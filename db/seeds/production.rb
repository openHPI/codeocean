say(<<~CONFIRMATION_MESSAGE)
  Production data has been seeded successfully.

  As part of this setup, a test email was sent to \
  '#{email}'. You can safely ignore this mail as your \
  account is already confirmed. However, if you \
  haven't received any email, you should check the \
  server's mail settings.

  Additionally, some execution environments have been \
  stored in the database. However, these haven't been yet \
  synchronized with a runner management. Please take care \
  to configure a runner management according to the \
  documentation and synchronize environments thorugh the \
  user interface. To do so, open `/execution_environments` \
  and click on the "Synchronize all" button.
